# What is tint2? #

tint2 is a simple _**panel/taskbar**_ made for modern X window managers. It was specifically made for _**openbox3**_ but should also work with other window managers (GNOME, KDE, XFCE etc.). It is based on ttm http://code.google.com/p/ttm/


# Features #

  * Panel with taskbar, system tray, clock and launcher icons;
  * Easy to customize: color/transparency on fonts, icons, borders and backgrounds;
  * Pager like capability: send tasks from one workspace (virtual desktop) to another, switch between workspaces;
  * Multi-monitor capability: one panel per monitor, shows only the tasks from the current monitor;
  * Customizable mouse events.


# Goals #

  * Keep tint2 unintrusive and light (in terms of memory, CPU and aesthetic);
  * Follow the freedesktop.org specifications;
  * Make certain workflows, such as 'multi-desktop' and 'multi-monitor', easy to use.
